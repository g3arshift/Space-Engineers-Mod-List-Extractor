# Space Engineers Mod List Extractor
This application takes any Space Engineers configuration file, the Sandbox_config.sbc file, and pulls out a list of Steam workshop URLs for each mod a save is using. This can be particularly useful on servers with large mod lists, or if you need to revise a mod list on an existing server but don't want to do so in game.

To run the project, simply double-click the jar file and follow the on-screen instructions.
